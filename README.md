# Isnan Data Science Portfolio Summary

## Poject 1 Data Visualization Project: Premier League 20/21 Exploratory Data Overview
* Data Exploration of Premier League Season 2020 / 2021 Overall Stats and SUmmary
* VIsualize from data including `Total Goals` scored, Succesfull  `Assist`, Attempted `Passes` for both  in individual players or in collective club
* Gain insight, pattern and interesting piece of findings from data visualization and giving my personal opinion in regards to that matter.

## ## Project 2 Data Science Regression Modeling : California Housing Price Prediction Overview <br>
* Build a machine learning regression model to estimate and predict housing price located in california region.
* Engineered some feaures to better specify how many rooms, bedrooms per rooms, bedrooms per household and population per household.
* Exploratory data with seaborn and matplotlib help giving better understanding of which specific area having the heighest or lowest house price and which are the most densely populated.
* One hot encoding and standard scaler are used to pre process dataaset before implemented it to machine learning model.
* Linear regression, Support Vector regression and Tree based and Gradient boosting regressor model are used alongside gridsearch cv to find and optimize the best best model.

## Project 3 Data Science Classification : Telcom Churn Classification Overview
* Build a machine learning model to predict and classify wether a certain Telcom customers would churn from internet / broadband services.
* Telcom customer records data of over 7000 ID's / customers.
* Feature engineered and transformation for dataset to better be read and be implemented to model.
* Data Exploration gives us better understanding which any of the criterias leading up to customer end subscribing to telcom's internet / broadband service.
* Using `Tree-based algorithm's feature importance` to determine which features contributes the most in terms of customer churn.
* Optimized Tree-based algorithm to output higher score `Accuracy, F1, Precision, Recall`.

## Project 4 Data Science Classification : United States Cityzen Income Classification Overview
* Build a machine learning model to classify United States citizen's income falls into below 50K or above 50K a year.
* Uniterd States records of over 30.000 cityzen.
* Feature Engineered several features for dataset to be easier to read and be inplemented by machine learning model.
* Data Exploration helps giving insight the distribution of `Income` category based on `Education, Occupation, Workclass`. and how much cityzen having an income based on them `Marital-Status` or `Relationship`.
* Using `Tree-based algorithm's feature importance` to determine which features contributes

## Project 5 Data Science Forecasting : US E-commerce Sales and Profit Forecasting with ARIMA and FBProphet Overview
* Build a tool to forecast snd predict the trend and value of sales and profit of one of US E commerce.
* Dataset contains records of E commerce succesful sales from january 2015 to december 2015
* Feature Engineered date feature to date time type for easier to converto data to to time series.
* Data Exploration giving a better understanding which products sold the most, generates most profit and where the sales / pofit mostly comes from.
* Auto ARIMA and FBProphet as tool to forecast sales and profit of the dataset.
