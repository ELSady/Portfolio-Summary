Property valuation is an imprecise science. Individual appraisers and valuers bring their own experience, metrics and skills to a job. Consistency is difficult, with UK and Australian-based studies suggesting valuations between two professionals can differ by up to 40%. Perhaps a well-trained machine could perform this task in place of a human, with greater consistency and accuracy.
Let’s prototype this idea and train some ML models using data about a house’s features, costs and neighbourhood profile to predict its value. Our target variable the houses's  price is numerical, hence the ML task is regression. (For a categorical target, the task becomes classification.).
We’ll use a dataset from california housing data which simulates a portfolio of 20.640 properties, there are 10 columns.

## [#2 Data Science Project Classification : Telcom Churn Classification Overview](https://github.com/ELSady/Classification-Telcom-Churn-Modeling/blob/main/README.md)
* Build a machine learning model to predict and classify wether a certain Telcom customers would churn from internet / broadband services.
* Telcom customer records data of over 7000 ID's / customers.
* Feature engineered and transformation for dataset to better be read and be implemented to model.
* Data Exploration gives us better understanding which any of the criterias leading up to customer end subscribing to telcom's internet / broadband service.
* Using several classifier models to determine which features contributes the most in terms of customer churn.

Customer attrition (a.k.a customer churn) is one of the biggest expenditures of any organization. If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold. Let’s make use of athis Telco customer transaction dataset from to understand the key steps involved in predicting customer attrition. <br>

Supervised Machine Learning is nothing but learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. A supervised machine learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. Given that we have data on current and prior customer transactions in the telecom dataset, this is a standardized supervised classification problem that tries to predict a binary outcome (Y/N). <br>

## [#3 Data Science Project Clustering : Airlines Customer Segmentation and Analysis Overview](https://github.com/ELSady/Clustering-Airflight-Customer-Segmentation-and-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
* Build an Unsupervised Model to cluster and help segment Airlines customers in which what cluster / categories they fall into.
* Implementing K means algorithm as base clustering model with a various thresholds number of K / Cluster Number.
* Using An Airlines data, we analyze differents characteristics, provides specialized services for each respective customer categories , and formulate Corresponding marketing strategy.
* Customer segmentation plotting helps us gives better insight of how each customer clusters differ to one another.

Customer segmentation is the process by which we divide our customers up based on common characteristics – such as demographics or behaviours, so you can market to those customers more effectively.These customer segmentation groups can also be used to begin discussions of building a marketing persona. Customer segmentation is typically used to inform a brand’s messaging, positioning and to improve how a business sells – so marketing personas need to be closely aligned to those customer segments in order to be effective.The marketing “persona” is by definition a personification of a customer segment, and it is not uncommon for businesses to create several personas to match their different customer segments.But for that to happen, a business needs a robust set of customer segments off of which to base it. Which leads us to the next section, distinguishing the difference between customer segmentation and market segmentation, so that the segmentation is as accurate as possible.

## Project Highlight

### Features / Columns Explanation
* `Name`, as it suggest, it specifies the name of players. <br>
* `Club`, specifies players current club in which they play for in the League.<br>
* `Nationality`, specifies player's current football national they play at International level. <br>
* `Position`, specifies role or responsibility at the team. <br>
* `Age`, specifies the age of players. <br>
* `Matches`, specifies player's total appereances or total fixtures they played during that campaign. <br>
* `Starts`, specifies player's amount of fixtures when they were selected to play and feature in the Starting Line up (Starting X!). <br>
* `Mins`, specifies player's total minutes played in the league during that campaign. <br>
* `Goals`, specifies player's tota l amount of golas they scored. <br>
* `Assists`, specifies player's total amount of assist / pass in which leads to goal. <br>
* `Passes_Attempted`, specifies player's total amount of passes they attempted. <br>
* `Perc_Passes_Completed`, specifies player's total amount of success passes, a pass where it did not get intercepted by the opposition player, in percentage. <br>
* `Penalty_Goals`, specifies player's total amount of penalty which lead to goals. <br>
* `Penalty_Attempted`, specifies player's total amount of penalty the attempted. <br>
* `XG, or Expected Goals`, specifies the likelihood of a player to score a goal per 90 minutes basis (per one fixture), the higher the value means a player is very clinical in front of goal. <br>
* `XA, or Expected Assist`, similar to XG, specifies the likelihood of a player to create an assist pass per 90 minutes basis, the higher the value means a player is very creative in making passes which lead to a goal. <br>
* `Yellow_cards`, specifies player's total yellow cards tey got during the campaign. <br>
* `Red_cards`, specifies player's total red cards they got during the campaign. <br>


## [#5 Data Science Project : Ecommerce Profit-Sales RFM Customer Clustering and Analysis Overview](https://github.com/ELSady/Online-Ecommerce-Profit-Sales-RFM-Customer-CLustering-and-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
* Dataset of one of Ecommerce sited in US with a customer's purchase history over the course year of 2015.
* Analyse which products / categories's as well as product segment which provide the most inerms of profit and sales.
* Analyze and filter out which countries / regions which satisfies the 80% of sales / profit.
* Using Recency, Frequency and Monetary strategies to segment customers into certain groups based on the RFM scoring / metric.
* Build unsupervised K means model to further improve / confirm customer segmentation.

RFM analysis is a data driven customer behavior segmentation technique. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value. The idea is to segment customers based on when their last purchase was, how often they’ve purchased in the past, and how much they’ve spent overall. All three of these measures have proven to be effective predictors of a customer's willingness to engage in marketing messages and offers. While RFM analysis was born in direct-mail, it is a powerful tool for eCommerce stores to use today. RFM analysis allows us to make sense of all the customer data our store captures as part of interactions with the brand and customer transactions from the store. <br>
