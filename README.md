# Data Science Portfolio Summary

## [Data Science Project 1 Regression Modeling : California Housing Price Prediction Overview](https://github.com/ELSady/Regression-California-Housing-Price-Prediction/blob/main/README.md)
## Data Science Project Regression Modeling : California Housing Price Prediction Overview <br>
* Build a machine learning regression model to estimate and predict housing price located in california region.
* Engineered some feaures to better specify how many rooms, bedrooms per rooms, bedrooms per household and population per household.
* Features categorical encoding and Robust scaler are used to pre process dataaset before implemented it to machine learning model.
* Several machine learning models are used alongside gridsearch cv to find and optimize the best best model.

Property valuation is an imprecise science. Individual appraisers and valuers bring their own experience, metrics and skills to a job. Consistency is difficult, with UK and Australian-based studies suggesting valuations between two professionals can differ by up to 40%. Perhaps a well-trained machine could perform this task in place of a human, with greater consistency and accuracy.
Let’s prototype this idea and train some ML models using data about a house’s features, costs and neighbourhood profile to predict its value. Our target variable the houses's  price is numerical, hence the ML task is regression. (For a categorical target, the task becomes classification.).
We’ll use a dataset from california housing data which simulates a portfolio of 20.640 properties, there are 10 columns.

## [Data Science Project 2 Classification : Telcom Churn Classification Overview](https://github.com/ELSady/Classification-Telcom-Churn-Modeling/blob/main/README.md)
* Build a machine learning model to predict and classify wether a certain Telcom customers would churn from internet / broadband services.
* Telcom customer records data of over 7000 ID's / customers.
* Feature engineered and transformation for dataset to better be read and be implemented to model.
* Data Exploration gives us better understanding which any of the criterias leading up to customer end subscribing to telcom's internet / broadband service.
* Using several classifier models to determine which features contributes the most in terms of customer churn.

Customer attrition (a.k.a customer churn) is one of the biggest expenditures of any organization. If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold. Let’s make use of athis Telco customer transaction dataset from to understand the key steps involved in predicting customer attrition. <br>

Supervised Machine Learning is nothing but learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. A supervised machine learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. Given that we have data on current and prior customer transactions in the telecom dataset, this is a standardized supervised classification problem that tries to predict a binary outcome (Y/N). <br>

## [Data Science Project 3 Clustering : Airlines Customer Segmentation and Analysis Overview](https://github.com/ELSady/Clustering-Airflight-Customer-Segmentation-and-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
* Build an Unsupervised Model to cluster and help segment Airlines customers in which what cluster / categories they fall into.
* Implementing K means algorithm as base clustering model with a various thresholds number of K / Cluster Number.
* Using An Airlines data, we analyze differents characteristics, provides specialized services for each respective customer categories , and formulate Corresponding marketing strategy.
* Customer segmentation plotting helps us gives better insight of how each customer clusters differ to one another.

Customer segmentation is the process by which we divide our customers up based on common characteristics – such as demographics or behaviours, so you can market to those customers more effectively.These customer segmentation groups can also be used to begin discussions of building a marketing persona. Customer segmentation is typically used to inform a brand’s messaging, positioning and to improve how a business sells – so marketing personas need to be closely aligned to those customer segments in order to be effective.The marketing “persona” is by definition a personification of a customer segment, and it is not uncommon for businesses to create several personas to match their different customer segments.But for that to happen, a business needs a robust set of customer segments off of which to base it. Which leads us to the next section, distinguishing the difference between customer segmentation and market segmentation, so that the segmentation is as accurate as possible.
