Property valuation is an imprecise science. Individual appraisers and valuers bring their own experience, metrics and skills to a job. Consistency is difficult, with UK and Australian-based studies suggesting valuations between two professionals can differ by up to 40%. Perhaps a well-trained machine could perform this task in place of a human, with greater consistency and accuracy.
Let’s prototype this idea and train some ML models using data about a house’s features, costs and neighbourhood profile to predict its value. Our target variable the houses's  price is numerical, hence the ML task is regression. (For a categorical target, the task becomes classification.).
We’ll use a dataset from california housing data which simulates a portfolio of 20.640 properties, there are 10 columns.

Customer attrition (a.k.a customer churn) is one of the biggest expenditures of any organization. If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold. Let’s make use of athis Telco customer transaction dataset from to understand the key steps involved in predicting customer attrition. <br>

Supervised Machine Learning is nothing but learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. A supervised machine learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples. Given that we have data on current and prior customer transactions in the telecom dataset, this is a standardized supervised classification problem that tries to predict a binary outcome (Y/N). <br>

## [#3 Data Science Project Clustering : Airlines Customer Segmentation and Analysis Overview](https://github.com/ELSady/Clustering-Airflight-Customer-Segmentation-and-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
* Build an Unsupervised Model to cluster and help segment Airlines customers in which what cluster / categories they fall into.
* Implementing K means algorithm as base clustering model with a various thresholds number of K / Cluster Number.
* Using An Airlines data, we analyze differents characteristics, provides specialized services for each respective customer categories , and formulate Corresponding marketing strategy.
* Customer segmentation plotting helps us gives better insight of how each customer clusters differ to one another.

Customer segmentation is the process by which we divide our customers up based on common characteristics – such as demographics or behaviours, so you can market to those customers more effectively.These customer segmentation groups can also be used to begin discussions of building a marketing persona. Customer segmentation is typically used to inform a brand’s messaging, positioning and to improve how a business sells – so marketing personas need to be closely aligned to those customer segments in order to be effective.The marketing “persona” is by definition a personification of a customer segment, and it is not uncommon for businesses to create several personas to match their different customer segments.But for that to happen, a business needs a robust set of customer segments off of which to base it. Which leads us to the next section, distinguishing the difference between customer segmentation and market segmentation, so that the segmentation is as accurate as possible.

## [#4 Data Science Project : Ecommerce Profit-Sales RFM Customer Clustering and Analysis Overview](https://github.com/ELSady/Online-Ecommerce-Profit-Sales-RFM-Customer-CLustering-and-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
* Dataset of one of Ecommerce sited in US with a customer's purchase history over the course year of 2015.
* Analyse which products / categories's as well as product segment which provide the most inerms of profit and sales.
* Analyze and filter out which countries / regions which satisfies the 80% of sales / profit.
* Using Recency, Frequency and Monetary strategies to segment customers into certain groups based on the RFM scoring / metric.
* Build unsupervised K means model to further improve / confirm customer segmentation.

RFM analysis is a data driven customer behavior segmentation technique. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value. The idea is to segment customers based on when their last purchase was, how often they’ve purchased in the past, and how much they’ve spent overall. All three of these measures have proven to be effective predictors of a customer's willingness to engage in marketing messages and offers. While RFM analysis was born in direct-mail, it is a powerful tool for eCommerce stores to use today. RFM analysis allows us to make sense of all the customer data our store captures as part of interactions with the brand and customer transactions from the store. <br>

## [#5 Data Science Project: Marketing Campaign Analysis Overview](https://github.com/ELSady/Marketing-Campaign-Analysis/blob/main/README.md)
* Dataset contains records of 2240 customers with their informations, their purchase / sales, and response for previous and the current campaign.
* Handling plus Feature Engineering several features, the likes of customer registered date, Age, Total Spending and Purchase Frequency.
* Visualize and Analyse customers's Relationship-Status, income Yearly and Education distribution, how each of these features correlates to total spending and response for current and prevous campaign.
* Visualize and Analyse customers response over the 5 past campaign.
* Build Supervised Machine learning Classification model, checking its feature importance and Shap value to determine which features contributes when it comes to predicting customer's response for the current campaign.

A marketing campaign is a comprehensive course of action to sell and promote something, either a product, service, or brand. In a marketing campaign, the team may have organized the promotion of goods through printed publications, radio, TV, billboards, banners, trade shows, conferences, online, and other kinds of media. Marketing campaigns promote products through different types of media, such as television, radio, print, and online platforms. Campaigns are not solely reliant on advertising and can include demonstrations, video conferencing, and other interactive techniques. Businesses operating in highly competitive markets and franchisees may initiate frequent marketing campaigns and devote significant resources to generating brand awareness and sales.

Financial institutions used credit risk analysis models to determine the probability of default of a potential borrower. The models provide information on the level of a borrower’s credit risk at any particular time. If the lender fails to detect the credit risk in advance, it exposes them to the risk of default and loss of funds. Lenders rely on the validation provided by credit risk analysis models to make key lending decisions on whether or not to extend credit to the borrower and the credit to be charged. With the continuous evolution of technology, banks are continually researching and developing effective ways of modeling credit risk. A growing number of financial institutions are investing in new technologies and human resources to make it possible to create credit risk models using machine learning languages.
